This repository contains files pertaining to the Pandas Homework due 16 Dec 2020.

Heroes of Pymoli: This code reads in a file of video game purchasing data (purchase_data.csv) and uses the Pandas library to perform the following analyses:

    Total Purchases
    Gender Demographics
    Purchasing by Gender
    Age Demographics
    Purchasing by Age
    Top Spenders
    Most Popular Items
    Most Profitable Items
    
   
Based on the analyses completed, the following observations can be made:

  1.  Far more males make in-app purchases than any other gender.
  2.  Most players fall into the age range 20-24 years.
  3.  Players aged 20-24 years account for the most in-app purchases.
  3.  Age demographics and purchases by age range fit a normal distribution.
